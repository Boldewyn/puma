                         PUBLICATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
                           for the Faculty of Physics
                        at the University of Regensburg

This software runs Puma.Phi, the publication management system for the
physicists at the University of Regensburg. The live running version can be
found at

    http://puma.uni-regensburg.de

Puma.Phi is based on Aigaion, <http://www.aigaion.nl>, and is licensed under
the terms of the GNU General Public License. The files in the /stuff/ folder
may have different terms of usage, and the license for the CodeIgniter
framework, which is different from the GPL, can be found in
/codeigniter/license.txt.


  INSTALLATION
  ============

To get started, download a copy of Aigaion from www.aigaion.nl and install it
as described there. This will create the necessary MySQL tables. Then remove
the Aigaion folder, replace it with Puma.Phi and run the SQL files found in
/stuff/sql/ to patch the database.

Finally create a file "credentials.php" in the root of your installation and
fill it with the following content:

<?php if (!defined('PUMA')) exit('No direct script access allowed');

define('AIGAION_SITEID', 'Puma');
define('AIGAION_DB_HOST', '__database__host__');
define('AIGAION_DB_USER', '__database__user__');
define('AIGAION_DB_PWD', '__database__password__');
define('AIGAION_DB_NAME', '__database__');
define('EXPORT_REPLY_ADDRESS', '__your__email__');
define('PUMA_LOGIN_KEY', '');

define('AIGAION_DB_PREFIX', 'puma_'); # adapt to what you entered
                                      # during Aigain setup
#Root URL of this instance Aigaion, WITH trailing slash
define('AIGAION_ROOT_URL','http://localhost/');
define('AIGAION_COOKIE_PATH','/');

?>
